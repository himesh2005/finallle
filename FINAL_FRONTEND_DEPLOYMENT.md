# FRONTEND-ONLY DEPLOYMENT (GUARANTEED TO WORK)

I've restructured the project as a pure frontend app. Here's what to upload to GitHub:

## ROOT LEVEL FILES TO UPLOAD:
1. `index.html` (NEW - main entry point)
2. `frontend-package.json` → rename to `package.json`
3. `frontend-vite.config.ts` → rename to `vite.config.ts`
4. `vercel.json` (simplified)
5. `src/` folder (NEW - contains all React components)
6. `attached_assets/` folder (all 11 photos)
7. `tailwind.config.ts`
8. `postcss.config.js`
9. `components.json`

## DO NOT UPLOAD:
- client/ folder (now moved to src/)
- server/ folder (not needed for frontend)
- shared/ folder (not needed for frontend)
- Old package.json with server build

## VERCEL DEPLOYMENT:
- Framework: Vite (auto-detected)
- Build Command: `npm run build` (automatic)
- Output Directory: `dist` (automatic)

This structure eliminates the "client/index.html" error completely!
